# supplyTrax

This repo contains some design and architecture artifacts for supplyTrax.

* `Trax2.svg` is a system diagram editable by Draw.io
* `EDIFACT UML-DIAGRAM` is a directory that contains the data model used for UN/EDIFACT EDI messages. The reason this is
  here is that we want to model all supply chain events in a way that can be readily translated to some kind of EDI
  message. This is included in the repo to have as a ready reference when designing the data model used by supplyTrax.
